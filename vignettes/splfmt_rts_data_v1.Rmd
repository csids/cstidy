## splfmt_rts_data_v1

This document presents the data format `splfmt_rts_data_v1`.

`splfmt_rts_data_v1` is the data format that the Sykdomspulsen team recommends using for the real-time surveillance of infectious diseases.

## Style

**Language**

English is the primary language for our code.

Names that are abbreviations or in Norwegian are kept as they are: data sources such as `msis`, `daar`, `sysvak`, `normomo`.

**Capital letters**

Capital letters are to be avoided whenever possible. This is also the case in filenames (e.g. `data.rds` is preferred to `data.RDS`)

**snake_case or camelCase?**

Use snake_case.

**Timestamping of file names**

In results (e.g. reports), an indicator of time when the files are created are necessary. It allows us to find which one is the most recent version of files with the same names, and it allows easy tracking of an Airflow error. 

e.g. `Epidemiologisk_situasjonsrapport_2021-05-31_0659.docx` for a report generated on May 31, 2021 06:59 AM. 

## Ordering of variables

Sometimes variables need to be ordered. Variables should be ordered as follows:

- time
- location
- age
- sex

e.g. A database table could be called `msis_by_time_location_age_sex` or a filename could be called `2020_oslo_05-10_male.xlsx`

## Time

Time functions can be obtained from [spltime](/spltime). Missing time data should be coded as `NA`. Uncommon/internal use is demarcated by a line through the text.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
d <- rbind(
  data.frame(
    granularity_time = "day",
    class = "Date",

### Approved events 

The following are approved events:

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
d <- rbind(
  data.frame(
    granularity_time = "event_covid19_norway_2020_02_21_to_9999_09_09",

    definition = "Covid-19 vaccination campaign in Norway (on-going)."
  )
)

gt::gt(d) %>%
  gt::tab_options(
    table.width = "750px"
  ) %>%
  gt::cols_width(
    granularity_time ~ "65%",
    definition ~ "35%"
  ) %>%
  gt::cols_align(
    align = "left"
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_header(title = "Approved events")
```

## Location

Locations can be obtained from [spldata](/spldata). Valid locations (and location types) are available in `spldata::nor_locations_names()`.  Uncommon/internal use is demarcated by a line through the text.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
d <- spldata::nor_locations_names()[, .(
  n = .N,
  location_code = location_code[1],
  location_name = location_name[1],
  location_name_description_nb = location_name_description_nb[1],
  location_name_file_nb_utf = location_name_file_nb_utf[1],
  location_name_file_nb_ascii = location_name_file_nb_ascii[1]
),
by = .(granularity_geo)
]

  ) %>%
  gt::tab_header(title = "Valid locations and location types in the splverse format") %>%
  gt::cols_label(
    granularity_geo = "Geo (Granularity)",
    n = "N"
  ) %>%
  # gt::cols_width(
  #   granularity_time ~ "20%",
  #   class ~ "15%",
  #   fn ~ "20%",
  #   example ~ "55%"
  # ) %>%
  gt::tab_spanner(
    label = "Examples",
    columns = c(location_code, location_name, location_name_description_nb, location_name_file_nb_utf, location_name_file_nb_ascii)
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_footnote(
    footnote = gt::md("**location_code**: Used a) **inside datasets** and b) in data **file names** for transfer of data/results between analytic systems. All values are unique."),
    locations = gt::cells_column_labels(
      columns = location_code
    )
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_footnote(
    footnote = gt::md("**location_name**: Used (rarely) **inside results** (figures, tables, documents). Can be confusing as some names are duplicated. Its rare usage is demarcated by a line through the text."),
    locations = gt::cells_column_labels(
      columns = location_name
    )
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_style(
    style = list(
      gt::cell_text(decorate = "line-through")
    ),
    locations = gt::cells_body(
      columns = location_name,
      rows = gt::everything()
    )
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_footnote(
    footnote = gt::md("**location_name_description_nb**: Used (frequently) **inside results** (figures, tables, documents). All values are unique."),
    locations = gt::cells_column_labels(
      columns = location_name_description_nb
    )
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_footnote(
    footnote = gt::md("**location_name_file_nb_utf**: Used (frequently) in the **file names** for results (figures, tables, documents). All values are unique."),
    locations = gt::cells_column_labels(
      columns = location_name_file_nb_utf
    )
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_footnote(
    footnote = gt::md("**location_name_file_nb_ascii**: Used (rarely) in the **file names** for results (figures, tables, documents). Used if file systems have problems with the Norwegian letters æøå. All values are unique."),
    locations = gt::cells_column_labels(
      columns = location_name_file_nb_ascii
    )
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_footnote(
    footnote = "Bo- og arbeidsmarkedsregioner. Housing and labor market regions.",
    locations = gt::cells_body(
      columns = granularity_geo,
      rows = granularity_geo == "baregion"
    )
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_footnote(
    footnote = "Mattilsynet-regioner. Food authority regions.",
    locations = gt::cells_body(
      columns = granularity_geo,
      rows = granularity_geo == "faregion"
    )
  )
```

## Ages

Ages should be coded as characters and should always contain 3 digits. If it is an age range, the two ages are joined by an underscore (e.g. `005_010`). 

Use `085p` instead of `>=085` or `85+`, as this will allow for an easy conversion from long to wide formatted data.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
d <- rbind(
  data.frame(
    value = "\"000\"",
    class = "character",
    definition = "One year age group (0 year olds)"
  ),
  data.frame(
    value = "\"079\"",
    class = "character",
    definition = "One year age group(79 year olds)"
  ),
  data.frame(
    value = "\"000_004\"",
    class = "character",
    definition = "Age span of 0-4 year olds"
  ),
  data.frame(
    value = "\"065p\"",
    class = "character",
    definition = "Age span of >=65 year olds"
  ),
  data.frame(
    value = "\"missing\"",
    class = "character",
    definition = "Missing/unknown"
  ),
  data.frame(
    value = "\"total\"",
    class = "character",
    definition = "Everyone"
  )
)

gt::gt(d) %>%
  gt::tab_header(title = "Valid ages in the splverse format") %>%
  gt::cols_label(
    value = "Value",
    definition = "Definition"
  )
```

This format will help your data be easily sorted, kept in the right order, and generate valid variable names if converted to wide-format.

Missing ages should be coded as "missing".

## Sex

Sex should be coded as characters.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
d <- rbind(
  data.frame(
    value = "\"male\"",
    class = "character",
    definition = "Male"
  ),
  data.frame(
    value = "\"female\"",
    class = "character",
    definition = "Female"
  ),
  data.frame(
    value = "\"missing\"",
    class = "character",
    definition = "Missing/unknown"
  ),
  data.frame(
    value = "\"total\"",
    class = "character",
    definition = "Everyone"
  )
)

gt::gt(d) %>%
  gt::tab_header(title = "Valid sexes in the splverse format") %>%
  gt::cols_label(
    value = "Value",
    definition = "Definition"
  )
```

Missing sexes should be coded as "missing".

## Unified columns

All datasets in the splverse format splfmt_rts_data_v1 will contain these 16 columns.

Time conversion functions can be found in package [spltime](https://docs.sykdomspulsen.no/spltime). 

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

  ),

  )
) %>%

### Smart assignment

`splfmt_rts_data_v1` does smart assignment for time and geography.

When the **variables in bold** are assigned using `:=`, the listed variables will be automatically imputed.

**location_code**:

- granularity_geo
- country_iso3

**isoyear**:

- granularity_time
- isoweek
- isoyearweek
- season
- seasonweek
- calyear
- calmonth
- calyearmonth
- date

**isoyearweek**:

- granularity_time
- isoyear
- isoweek
- season
- seasonweek
- calyear
- calmonth
- calyearmonth
- date

**date**:

- granularity_time
- isoyear
- isoweek
- isoyearweek
- season
- seasonweek
- calyear
- calmonth
- calyearmonth

## Context-specific columns 

Variable names that are not part of the [unified columns](#unified-columns) are called context-specific columns, and are made up of 2 mandatory (description, format) and 5 optional (time, statistics, forecast, censored/status, formatted) sections, separated by underscores.

The format is as follows:

```{yaml}
description[_time][_statistics]_format[_forecast][_censored/status][_formatted]
```

Where `[blah]` indicates an optional argument. It is rare that all of the optional arguments will be used at the same time.

### Examples

In the below examples, the description, time, statistics, format, and censor/status sections are separated by /.

An example relating to death and nowcasting:

- **deaths_registered/\_n**: Number of registered deaths.
- **deaths_nowcasted/\_n**: Number of registered deaths, corrected for registration delay (nowcasting).
- **deaths_nowcasted/\_n\_forecast**: Has 'deaths_nowcasted_n' been forecasted (i.e. nowcasted)?
- **deaths_nowcasted/\_n/\_censored**: Has 'deaths_nowcasted_n' been censored?

## In action

```{r}
d <- spltidy::generate_test_data()[1:5]
spltidy::set_splfmt_rts_data_v1(d)

# Looking at the dataset
d[]

# Smart assignment of time columns (note how granularity_time, isoyear, isoyearweek, date all change)
d[1, isoyearweek := "2021-01"]
d

# Smart assignment of time columns (note how granularity_time, isoyear, isoyearweek, date all change)
d[2, isoyear := 2019]
d

# Smart assignment of time columns (note how granularity_time, isoyear, isoyearweek, date all change)
d[4:5, date := as.Date("2020-01-01")]
d

# Smart assignment fails when multiple time columns are set
d[1, c("isoyear", "isoyearweek") := .(2021, "2021-01")]
d

# Smart assignment of geo columns
d[1, c("location_code") := .("norge")]
d

# Collapsing down to different levels, and healing the dataset
# (so that it can be worked on further with regards to real time surveillance)
d[, .(deaths_n = sum(deaths_n), location_code = "norge"), keyby = .(granularity_time)] %>%
  spltidy::create_unified_columns() %>%
  print()

# Collapsing down to different levels, without healing the dataset and without
# removing the class splfmt_rts_data_v1 (this is uncommon)
d[, .(deaths_n = sum(deaths_n), location_code = "norge"), keyby = .(granularity_time)] %>%
  print()

# Collapsing to different levels, and removing the class splfmt_rts_data_v1 because
# it is going to be used in new output/analyses
d[, .(deaths_n = sum(deaths_n), location_code = "norge"), keyby = .(granularity_time)] %>%
  spltidy::remove_class_splfmt_rts_data() %>%
  print()
```

## Expand time to

Sometimes you need to expand the number of rows in a dataset to a future time.

```{r}
spltidy::generate_test_data() %>%
  spltidy::set_splfmt_rts_data_v1() %>%
  dplyr::filter(location_code == "county03") %>%
  spltidy::expand_time_to(max_isoyearweek = "2022-08") %>%
  print()
```

## Time series

We might also need to identify how many time series are in one dataset.

```{r}
spltidy::generate_test_data() %>%
  spltidy::set_splfmt_rts_data_v1() %>%
  spltidy::unique_time_series()
```

## Summary

We need a way to easily summarize the data structure of a dataset.

```{r}
spltidy::generate_test_data() %>%
  spltidy::set_splfmt_rts_data_v1() %>%
  summary()
```

## Identifying data structure of one column

We need a way to easily summarize the data structure of one column inside a dataset.

```{r}
spltidy::generate_test_data() %>%
  spltidy::set_splfmt_rts_data_v1() %>%
  spltidy::identify_data_structure("deaths_n") %>%
  plot()
```

## Reference (Location)

Locations can be obtained from [spldata](/spldata). Valid locations (and location types) are available in `spldata::nor_locations_names()`.

Here we list as a reference table the valid `location_code`s and `location_name_description_nb`s (the two most commonly used locations).

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
d <- spldata::nor_locations_names()[, .(
  location_order = paste0("#", location_order),
  location_code,
  location_name_description_nb
)]

gt::gt(d) %>%
  gt::tab_options(
    table.width = "750px"
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_header(title = "Reference table of location_code and location_name_description_nb") %>%
  gt::cols_label(
    location_order = "#"
  )
```
